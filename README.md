# AI Interview Platform

**AI Interview** is a Next.js-based platform that simulates DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) interviews. It utilizes **Puppeteer** with the **AWS Chromium browser** for web scraping to bypass Cloudflare security headers and fetch questions directly from LeetCode. The platform allows users to solve random questions in a simulated interview environment and automatically syncs their progress to their LeetCode account.
