# AI Interview Platform

**AI Interview** is a Next.js-based platform that simulates DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) interviews. It utilizes **Puppeteer** with the **AWS Chromium browser** for web scraping to bypass Cloudflare security headers and fetch questions directly from LeetCode. The platform allows users to solve random questions in a simulated interview environment and automatically syncs their progress to their LeetCode account.

## Features

### üîç LeetCode Integration

- Uses **Puppeteer** and **AWS Chromium browser** to scrape LeetCode questions while bypassing Cloudflare‚Äôs security checks.
- Fetches three random questions for each interview session.

### üß© Simulated Interview Experience

- Realistic DSA interviews with timed coding challenges.
- Allows users to select question difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Automatically updates your progress on your LeetCode account.

### üîê Secure Authentication

- Authenticate with your **LeetCode x-csrf-token** and **cookie** to sync your activity.
- Ensures a personalized experience by directly interacting with your LeetCode account.

### üöÄ Local Usage for Smooth Performance

- While the application supports a serverless architecture, it is recommended to run the platform locally for optimal performance due to Puppeteer‚Äôs resource-heavy nature.

## For more information

Visit the github page https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30034
This includes the error in configuring the puppeter in Next.js
So i used the package **sparticuz/chromium-min** which helped me to run the puppeter in serverless artitecture like vercel without the build error.
